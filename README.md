# Logic-of-Thought Smart Home Agent Report

## 1. Project Overview

This project implements a logical agent for smart home automation using the Logic-of-Thought approach. The system converts natural language inputs into actionable commands through propositional logic constructs and AI-powered reasoning.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Core Components

#### Propositional Logic Operators

```python
def NOT(p): return not p
def AND(p, q): return p and q
def OR(p, q): return p or q
def IMPLIES(p, q): return (not p) or q
def IFF(p, q): return p == q
```

#### Knowledge Base Structure

- Facts: Dynamic set storing current system state
- Rules: List of logical implications
- State: Dictionary tracking device conditions

### 2.2 Environment States

```python
WEATHER_FREEZING = "freezing"
WEATHER_COLD = "cold"
WEATHER_WARM = "warm"
WEATHER_HOT = "hot"
```

### 2.3 Device States

```python
DEVICE_ON = "On"
DEVICE_OFF = "Off"
DEVICE_DIMMED = "Dimmed"
DEVICE_HEATING = "Heating"
DEVICE_COOLING = "Cooling"
DEVICE_VENTILATION = "Ventilation"
DEVICE_ARMED = "Armed"
DEVICE_HOME_MODE = "Home Mode"
DEVICE_DISARMED = "Disarmed"
```

## 3. Logical Facts and Rules

### 3.1 Fact Categories

#### Environmental Facts

- Weather conditions (freezing, cold, warm, hot)
- User presence (at_home, not_home, leaving, arriving)
- Time conditions (is_time_7, is_daytime)

#### User Intent Facts

- Lighting control (lamp_on, lamp_off, lamp_dimmed)
- Climate control (heating, cooling, ventilation)
- Security settings (armed, home_mode, disarmed)
- Device control (tv_on/off, curtain_open/closed)

### 3.2 Rule Implementation

#### Climate Control Rules

```python
tell_rule("freezing_weather AND user_at_home -> turn_on_heater")
tell_rule("hot_weather AND user_at_home -> turn_on_cooler")
```

#### Energy Conservation Rules

```python
tell_rule("user_not_home -> curtain_closed")
tell_rule("user_not_home -> turn_off_thermostat")
tell_rule("is_daytime AND user_at_home -> turn_off_lamp")
```

#### Wake-up Routine Rules

```python
tell_rule("is_time_7 AND user_at_home AND freezing_weather -> turn_on_heater")
tell_rule("is_time_7 AND user_at_home AND cold_weather -> turn_on_heater")
tell_rule("is_time_7 AND user_at_home -> curtain_open")
```

## 4. Natural Language Processing

### 4.1 Gemini AI Integration

```python
def generete_facts_from_gemini(user_input):
    prompt = f"""
    You are a smart home agent that infers logical facts from user input.
    User input: "{user_input}"
    Available facts: {available_facts}
    Infer the most relevant facts and return as JSON array.
    """
    # Gemini API call and response processing
```

### 4.2 Fact Inference Process

1. Natural language input received
2. Gemini analyzes input against available facts
3. System adds inferred facts to knowledge base
4. Rule evaluation triggers actions

## 5. Scenario Testing Results

### 5.1 Freezing Weather Scenario

```
Input: System initialized with freezing weather
Facts: freezing_weather, user_at_home
Actions: Heater activated automatically
```

### 5.2 User Departure Scenario

```
Input: "i am leaving"
Facts: user_leaving -> user_not_home
Actions: Curtains closed, thermostat off
```

### 5.3 Manual Control Scenario

```
Input: "open the curtain"
Facts: user_wants_curtain_open
Actions: Curtains opened
```

### 5.4 Climate Override Scenario

```
Input: "turn on ventilation"
Facts: user_wants_ventilation
Actions: Ventilation activated despite weather
```

### 5.5 Wake-up Routine Scenario

```
Input: Time set to 7:00 AM, cold weather
Facts: is_time_7, cold_weather, user_at_home
Actions: Heater on, curtains opened
```

## 6. Logical Reasoning Process

### 6.1 Rule Evaluation Engine

```python
def evaluate_premise(premise):
    if "AND" in premise:
        parts = premise.split("AND")
        results = [evaluate_premise(part.strip()) for part in parts]
        return all(results)
    elif "OR" in premise:
        parts = premise.split("OR")
        results = [evaluate_premise(part.strip()) for part in parts]
        return any(results)
    elif premise.startswith("NOT "):
        fact = premise[4:].strip()
        return NOT(fact in facts)
    else:
        return premise in facts
```

### 6.2 Action Execution

```python
def apply_action(action):
    action_map = {
        "turn_on_heater": ("thermostat", DEVICE_HEATING),
        "turn_on_cooler": ("thermostat", DEVICE_COOLING),
        "turn_on_ventilation": ("thermostat", DEVICE_VENTILATION),
        # Additional mappings
    }
```
