INITIAL SYSTEM STATE
===================

All devices start in their default inactive states:
- Thermostat: Off
- Lamp: Off
- Curtains: Closed
- Television: Off
- Smart Security: Disarmed


PRE-DEFINED SYSTEM RULES
========================

Automatic Weather Response:
- If weather is freezing and user is at home, thermostat will automatically switch to heating mode. User can manually set it to Cooling or Ventilation or Off.
- If weather is cold and user is at home, thermostat remains off unless manually triggered to Cooling or Heating or Ventilation or Off. 
- If weather is warm and user is at home, thermostat remains off unless manually triggered to Cooling or Heating or Ventilation or Off.
- If weather is hot and user is at home, thermostat will automatically switch to cooling mode. User can manually set it to Heating or Ventilation or Off.

Daylight and Light Control:
- If it is daytime (7:00 - 19:00) and user is at home, lamp will be turned off automatically. User can manually turn it on or dim or off.

Wake-up Routine:
- If time is 7:00 and user is at home, then thermostat will be set to relevant temperature control based on weather conditions and curtains will be opened.
